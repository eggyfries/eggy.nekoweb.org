Hello guys, gals, they, and everyone inbetween! Welcome to the source code for my personal website.

There's not really much of interest here, at least not yet, and a lot of it is taken from others (with credit ofc).
However, I have laid out a few general rules/things to expect:
  1. NO AI
  2. probably some original music
  3. funnies

It's probably going to be a while before anything actually interesting gets added, but i'm making it my goal to work on this for at least 9 hours a week. 
Hopefully this means that there will be something *eventually*. I will be updating this file as changes are made. 
In a while, crocodile!

I remain,
     eggy
